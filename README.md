i don't know what you expected from me i don't even know how to code 

hi meems here and I put useful things here sometimes.

â€®

I'm Currently working on mike world stuff, mental health, and Fixing my very bad reputation.

"I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone" - Kanye West, Homecoming

So because i am very controversal, im not allowed to be in the Scratch Community as much as i would like, which makes me sound crazy when i say "i'm inproving my mental health" when all they see is a very crazy person whos a jerk.
When in realitiy i'm very kind and trying to befriend the people i've hurt. I'm not crazy, i'm just hurt.
